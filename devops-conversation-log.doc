# DevOps Pipeline and Kubernetes Deployment Conversation Log

## 1. Add Dockerfile
- Added a Dockerfile for a Vite-based React app using Node 20-alpine.

## 2. Add GitHub Actions Workflow for ACR
- Created `.github/workflows/docker-acr.yml` to build and push Docker image to Azure Container Registry (ACR).
- Required secrets: `ACR_LOGIN_SERVER`, `ACR_USERNAME`, `ACR_PASSWORD`.

## 3. Tag Docker Image with Build ID
- Modified workflow to tag Docker images with both `latest` and the GitHub Actions build ID (`github.run_id`).

## 4. Integrate Trivy Security Scan
- Added Trivy steps to install and scan the Docker image for vulnerabilities before pushing to ACR.
- The pipeline fails if critical or high vulnerabilities are found.

## 5. Add Kubernetes Deployment and Service YAML
- Created `k8s-deployment.yaml` with Deployment and ClusterIP Service objects.
- Image reference uses `<ACR_LOGIN_SERVER>/vite-react-app:latest` (later templated).

## 6. Split Workflow: Build and Deploy Jobs
- Workflow split into two jobs:
  - `build-and-push`: Builds, scans, and pushes the Docker image.
  - `deploy-to-aks`: Deploys to AKS after a successful build.
- Required additional secrets: `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`, `AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP`, `AKS_CLUSTER_NAME`.

## 7. Deploy to Existing Namespace
- Modified deploy job to use `kubectl apply -f ... --namespace ${{ secrets.AKS_NAMESPACE }}`.
- Required secret: `AKS_NAMESPACE`.

## 8. Use Build ID in Image Reference
- Updated `k8s-deployment.yaml` to use `<BUILD_ID>` as the image tag placeholder.
- Workflow replaces `<BUILD_ID>` with the actual build ID during deployment.

## 9. Error Handling
- User reported: "Internal server error. Correlation ID: 28556931-eb47-418d-be98-77adaec6ac30 The job was not acquired by Runner of type hosted even after multiple attempts."
- This is an Azure/GitHub runner infrastructure issue, not related to pipeline YAML or code.
